# Frontend Study Tasks

A collection of practice tasks completed during my frontend development training.  
Each task focuses on building and improving skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains one completed exercise, for example:

- `01-registration-form`
- `02-profile-card`
- `03-pricing-table`
- ...

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3** — layout, positioning, flexbox, grid, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — scripts, logic, and dynamic interaction (in later tasks)
- **Git / GitHub** — version control and commit history

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal log of daily progress and hands-on practice.  
By committing every completed task, I track my consistency and growth as a developer.
